# 🕊️ Dhi Pravaha

**The Stream of Truth, Articulated.**

Dhi Pravaha is an AI-powered publishing loop built to convert fleeting thoughts into timeless articulation. It merges two powerful agents—**Kalpak** (the writer) and **Pratibimb** (the reviewer)—into a seamless, reflective system. Their interplay produces writing that is not only structurally sound but also spiritually resonant.

## 🧭 System Philosophy

> "Creation. Reflection. Refinement. Truth."

Dhi Pravaha is not a content engine. It is a **loop of thoughtstream**—where your ideas evolve through expression, critique, iteration, and insight. The system doesn’t just help you write better; it helps you *think clearer* and *know deeper*.

Each cycle of Dhi Pravaha brings you closer to the essence of what you're truly trying to say.

## 🧠 Components

### 1. ✍️ Kalpak — The Voice of the Inner Writer

Kalpak is a content generator, deeply tuned to:
- Your **intent and emotional register**
- Literary, philosophical, and cultural **inspiration libraries**
- Structural clarity via adaptive **shell modes**
- Rhythmic and metaphorical expression via the **Voice Codex** and **Voice Variant Composer (VVC)**

#### Shell Modes
Kalpak selects or prompts you for one of five modes:
- **Parth Core** – Reflective, clear, default structure
- **Sharp** – Executive, punchy, LinkedIn-friendly
- **Thinker** – Philosophical depth, paradox, callbacks
- **Explorer** – Curious, playful, informal
- **Operator** – Tactical, system-driven, pragmatic

#### Stylistic Libraries
- **Western Register**: Woolf, Gaiman, Rand, Tolstoy, Ted Chiang
- **Indic Register**: Adi Shankaracharya, Kalidasa, Vyasa (Gita), Kabir, Sri Aurobindo

#### VC & VVC (Voice Tools)
Kalpak uses:
- **Voice Codex (VC)** to store your core lines
- **Voice Variant Composer (VVC)** to create stylistic rewrites:
  - Rhythm  
  - Metaphor  
  - Minimalist/Philosophical  
  - Narrative  
  - **Indic** (e.g., shloka, contradiction, cosmic reflection)

### 2. 🪞 Pratibimb — The Reflective Editor

Pratibimb is your editor-critic, grounded in both literary nuance and structural rigor. It evaluates:
- **Tone**
- **Flow**
- **Depth**
- **Style**
- **Cohesion**
- **Emotional Resonance**
- **Originality**

Each review consists of:
1. **Summary Table** with high-level notes  
2. **Section-wise Feedback** with targeted suggestions  
3. **Comments on Structure & Voice**  
4. **Editorial Inspirations Used**: (e.g., Max Perkins, Toni Morrison, Gordon Lish, Robert Gottlieb)

4. **Iterate Together** → Changes applied or refined via loop  
5. **Final Output** → The polished article  
6. **Meta Reflection** → What was learned from this loop  
7. **Optional Contradiction Check** → Kalpak tests internal coherence  
8. **User Growth Insight** → Reflections on your writing, patterns, and next edge
